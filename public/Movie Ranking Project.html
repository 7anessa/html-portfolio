 <h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Kpop Demon Hunters</h3>
 <p>It sounds cliche at a glance, but this movie moved me to tears upon witnessing the characters' courage in fighting their inner demons. While others see a "girly, kids' movie," I see the universal message of bravery, authenticity, friendship, forgiveness, and emotional freedom.</p>
 <h3>Radio</h3>
 <p>This movie is based on a true story about an intellectually disabled man who was adopted by, first, a football coach, then the school the coach worked at. It's a touching movie about kindness, acceptance, and community. I love a heart-warming, feel-good movie.</p>
 <h3>The Green Mile</h3>
 <p>This one was a little bit hard for me to watch. It's a detailed movie featuring a wrongfully imprisoned man with a gift. Although a sad movie, I felt inspired by the gifted man's ability to act out of love despite his negative treatment and circumstances. </p>
