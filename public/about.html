<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born and raised in Washington state, I have an appreciation for the mountains, rivers, and evergreen trees.</p>

<p>I am passionate about self expression and helping brands do the same. My forte lies in guiding startups towards establishing
  a strong brand identity through thoughtful design and strategic marketing. I believe that every brand has a unique story to tell,
  and I am dedicated to helping them communicate that story effectively to their target audience.
